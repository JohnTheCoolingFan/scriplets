# Scriplets

Scriplets is an RTS game about programming. You program units to do certain tasks. Some improvement here, some there and you may end up with a logistic empire that colonises planets and solar systems all by itself! The game is a WIP, no actual gameplay yet. But there is a great potential.

# Status aand future

At this point there wasn't any active development going on for a long time, so the project may be considered abandoned. Although, some useful techniques were used in this project, which can be used in the next iteration of the idea, which would require a rewrite that would accomodate server-client architecture and new positioning system (as well as API but that's another story). Stay tuned for progress on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/rqkaeYJhzS).

## Building

To build playable binaries, use `cargo build --no-default-features --release`. If you don't disable default features, a debug version will be compiled instead.

*Later these instructions will be replaced by a separate build instructions for a server and a client, this will happen after the game is split into these parts*
