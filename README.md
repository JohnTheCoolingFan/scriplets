# Scriplets

Scriplets is an RTS game about programming. You program units to do certain tasks. Some improvement here, some there and you may end up with a logistic empire that colonises planets and solar systems all by itself! The game is a WIP, no actual gameplay yet. But there is a great potential.

## Building

To build playable binaries, use `cargo build --release`. Regular build is in debug mode, which has some extra stuff enabled for easier development process.
