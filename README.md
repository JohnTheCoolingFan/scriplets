# Scriplets

Scriplets is an RTS game about programming. You program units to do certain tasks. Some improvement here, some there and you may end up with a logistic empire that colonises planets and solar systems all by itself! The game is a WIP, no actual gameplay yet. But there is a great potential.

## Building

To build playable binaries, use `cargo build --no-default-features --release`. If you don't disable default features, a debug version will be compiled instead.

*Later these instructions will be replaced by a separate build instructions for a server and a client, this will happen after the game is split into these parts*
